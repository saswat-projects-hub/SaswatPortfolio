      detailedDescription: `Product Teardown: User Onboarding Process — InstaPrepsAI

This teardown analyzes the user onboarding journey of InstaPrepsAI, an AI-powered edtech platform designed to build students’ exam confidence through personalized diagnostics, live mentorship, and gamified learning. The platform caters to learners preparing for JEE, NEET, Olympiads, and placements—focusing especially on Tier 2/3 cities where access to affordable, expert guidance is limited.

The study highlights InstaPrepsAI’s strong value proposition of transforming “confidence” into a measurable learning metric through a 7-minute AI Confidence Test and personalized confidence reports. The onboarding flow builds early trust via IIT/NIT mentor branding and social proof, while clear CTAs and minimal friction support conversions.

Key recommendations include optimizing the landing page to showcase confidence analytics upfront, improving permission prompts with transparent value communication, and reducing OTP friction. Overall, the teardown demonstrates how thoughtful onboarding design, emotional resonance, and AI-driven insights can together enhance user trust, retention, and engagement in edtech products.`,
